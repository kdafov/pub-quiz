# Project summary

This project is a fast-paced Pub Quiz game built in React, where users answer a series of 10 shuffled questions within a 15-second timer for each question. It tracks user answers, scores dynamically, and provides a detailed summary of correct and incorrect answers at the end, allowing users to replay for a better score.
